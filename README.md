# Coding Hero (LMS)

This project is a full-featured Learning Management System (LMS) developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It is designed to provide an efficient and intuitive platform for both administrators and users to interact with educational content. Administrators have the ability to manage courses, and oversee the platform's operation, while users can browse, purchase, and engage with various courses tailored to their learning needs.
